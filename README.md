Standard Form
The Standard Form of a Quadratic Equation looks like this:

Quadratic Equation: ax^2 + bx + c = 0 
a, b and c are known values. a can't be 0.
"x" is the variable or unknown (we don't know it yet).


Discriminant
D=b^2-4ac

when b^2 âˆ’ 4ac is positive, we get two Real solutions
when it is zero we get just ONE real solution or double root
when it is negative we don't have solution in real numbers(we get two Complex solutions)
